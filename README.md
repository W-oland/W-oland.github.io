Pseudocode: Header <all posts>. Under the header are headers which have links to older blog posts. The list is interactive. The list can be hidden by pressing <all posts>. When I submit a blog posts the list is automatically updated. 
If the collapsible list of previous blog posts is wanted to be interactive - each blogpost would be a click-object redirecting the user directly to the posted article - that needs to be embedded in the code so that each blogpost has an identifiable HTML key; a link of sorts.
