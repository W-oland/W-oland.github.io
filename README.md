Pseudocode: Header <all posts>. Under the header are headers which have links to older blog posts. The list is interactive. The list can be hidden by pressing <all posts>. When I submit a blog posts the list is automatically updated. 
If the collapsible list of previous blog posts is wanted to be interactive - each blogpost would be a click-object redirecting the user directly to the posted article - that needs to be embedded in the code so that each blogpost has an identifiable HTML key; a link of sorts. 
For a compay the general idea has to be something that people are willing to work towards a mutual goal. The goal has to bring people together. Second, it has to be tested with
  a very simple and cost-efficient manner. E.g. washingmachine in a mall type of way.
