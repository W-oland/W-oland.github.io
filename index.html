    <p id="demo"> If you really think about it, life in itself has no meaning. When one asks what is the meaning of life, the answer to that question is there isn't one.
    One can also ask if everything is meaningless why do anything; that is a much more meaningful question to pose. Work is an abstraction from that realization. When one cas the
    ability to distract oneself from such unbearable thoughts, life seems much more bearable. However, life is involved with much suffering. If anything is meaningless, why suffer?
    Why not end it all?</p>
    <p>Work is nothing more and nothing less than abstraction from that feeling of meaningfulness; the void of meaning of one's own existence. Devoting oneself to such an abstraction
    is nothing more and nothing less than incapability to face the fact that life has no meaning and the incapability to accpet that as a fact. </p>
